 * @brief          Decompresses an XZ stream from InputBuffer into OutputBuffer.
 *
 * @detail         The XZ stream must contain a single block with an LZMA2
 * filter and no BJC2 filters, using default LZMA properties, and using either
 * CRC32 or None as the checksum type.
 *
 * @param[in]      InputBuffer - A fully formed buffer containing the XZ stream.
 * @param[in]      InputSize - The size of the input buffer.
 * @param[in]      OutputBuffer - A fully allocated buffer to receive the
 * output. Callers can pass in NULL if they do not intend to decompress, in
 * combination with setting OutputSize to 0, in order to query the final
 * expected size of the decompressed buffer.
 * @param[in,out]  OutputSize - On input, the size of the buffer. On output, the
 *                 size of the decompressed result.
 *
 * @return         true - The input buffer was fully decompressed in
 * OutputBuffer, or no decompression was requested, the size of the decompressed
 *                 buffer was returned in OutputSize.
 *                 false - A failure occurred during the decompression process.
