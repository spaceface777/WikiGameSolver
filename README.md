## WikiGameSolver

a script that calculates the minimum number of link clicks required to get from one Wikipedia entry to another

NOTE: requires an adapted dump of the Wikipedia database, saved as the local file `db.sqlite` (roughly 7GB). You can [download one from the releases page](https://github.com/spaceface777/WikiGameSolver/releases) (English articles only), or [generate one yourself](db_gen/).
