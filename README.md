## WikiGameSolver

a script that calculates the minimum number of link clicks required to get from one Wikipedia entry to another

NOTE: requires a dump of the Wikipedia database, which you can either [download from the releases page](https://github.com/spaceface777/WikiGameSolver/releases) (en only), or [generate yourself](db_gen/)
